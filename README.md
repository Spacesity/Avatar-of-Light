When you lanch the python lancher, there will be a tick box at the bottom which says "Add to PATH", click the box to get a tick.

Once python is installed, download all the images for the game. Then, proceed to open "Command Prompt" in windows and open as administrator,

If the command prompt says your "pip" is outdates, then copy and paste this: python -m pip install -â€“upgrade pip

Once it has been successfully updated, open "IDLE Python" and go to File > New File and copy and paste the "Game Code". Proceed to "Run" (F5) and the game
should be ready to go.
